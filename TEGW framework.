\section{Composite Temporal Measurement Cost Function}
\label{sec:ctm_cost}

In accordance with the Convexity Transfer Methodology (CTM) and Temporal-Entangled Graph Weaving (TEGW) framework, the composite temporal measurement cost $J_{CTM\_YT}$ is defined as a weighted quadratic form capturing the deviation between a current state vector and a future intent vector, modulated by psychological and temporal gain factors.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
The general structure is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
J_{CTM\_YT} = C \cdot G_{YT} \cdot \|\theta - I_F\|^2 + A
\label{eq:ctm_cost}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^n$ denotes the current state vector.
    \item $I_F \in \mathbb{R}^n$ denotes the future intent vector.
    \item $C \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is a significant scaling constant.
    \item $A \approx 0$ is the author term ensuring neutrality.
    \item $G_{YT}$ is the psychological-temporal gain factor.
\end{itemize}

The gain factor is defined as:
\begin{equation}
G_{YT} = s \cdot (1 + b)
\label{eq:gain_factor}
\end{equation}
with $s \in [0,1]$ representing user satisfaction and $b \in \mathbb{R}$ representing topic bias.

\subsection{Expanded Quadratic Form}
The squared deviation term is given by:
\begin{equation}
\|\theta - I_F\|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\theta_i - I_{F,i})^2
\label{eq:state_gap}
\end{equation}

Optionally, a weighted form may be employed:
\begin{equation}
\|\theta - I_F\|_W^2 = (\theta - I_F)^\top W (\theta - I_F)
\label{eq:weighted_gap}
\end{equation}
where $W$ is a positive semidefinite weighting matrix.

\subsection{Illustrative Example}
For the case:


\[
\theta = (2.5,\,-1.0,\,0.5), \quad I_F = (2.0,\,-1.2,\,0.4)
\]




\[
s = 0.9, \quad b = 0.3, \quad C = 58.8632, \quad A = 0
\]


the deviation vector is:


\[
\Delta = (0.5,\,0.2,\,0.1), \quad \|\Delta\|^2 = 0.30
\]


yielding:


\[
G_{YT} = 0.9 \cdot (1+0.3) = 1.17
\]


and thus:


\[
J_{CTM\_YT} \approx 58.8632 \cdot 1.17 \cdot 0.30 \approx 21.33
\]
